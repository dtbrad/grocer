  <h3 class="text-center">How Grocer Works</h3>
  <p>
    Grocer is a web application that looks at email receipts from New Seasons Market in your gmail and from them creates a database of your shopping history. It has no connection to New Seasons Market itself, and relies entirely on the information contained in your receipts.
  </p>

  <p>
    As you probably guessed, you need a gmail account with email receipts inside of it in order to benefit the most from Grocer. However, even if you don't have gmail, or don't want to import your purchase history, you can still use Grocer. I've leveraged the existing product database into a "smart" shopping list maker that lets you easily and quickly build shopping lists with built-in price information.

  <p>
    In parsing receipts, Grocer relies on the html structure and the information inside of New Seasons Market email receipts in order to intelligently decide what is a product, unit price, weight, etc. Their email receipts are largely consistent in their organization, but pricing information is not always perfect - for many items (mostly from behind the counters), they do not consistently provide unit/per pound pricing or thorough item descriptions. Grocer fixes some of this behind the scenes, but there will still occasionally be head scratchers like a $7 bagel (which was most likely a loaded bagel sandwich). There may also be edge cases in their email presentation that Grocer has not yet seen and does not yet know how to process. In short, it will always be a work in progress.
